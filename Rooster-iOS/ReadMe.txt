Rooster started off as an iOS Catalyst app but that became a non-started when I couldn't get Sparkle to work with it, so I converted it to use the macOS Cocoa APIs (that was super fun).

I've taken some steps to make the code cross platform, but I've got a long way to go before making an iOS version.

Also, on iOS, you're not able to get delegate calendars from EventKit, so that reduces the usefulness of Rooster on iOS by alot.

-->> So the iOS code isn't building right now <---
