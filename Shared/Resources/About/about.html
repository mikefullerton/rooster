<h2>About Rooster</h2>
<p>Rooster ensures that you get to your virtual meetings on time by interrupting you at the the exact time you need to join a meeting. You will know that <b><i>now</i></b> is the time to join. It will keep bothering you until you take action. You will <b><i>not</i></b> inadvertently tune out Rooster at the start of a meeting. You can trust that Rooster won't let you be late.</p>

<p>Rooster looks at your calendars (with your explicit permission of course) and makes a list of the meetings your have for the day. When a meeting starts, and it's literally time to join, Rooster loudly crows like an obnoxious rooster until you tell it to be quiet (don't worry you can change the sound). Also, if there is a virtual location (like a Webex meeting url) in the meeting information, Rooster will try to open that url automatically (if you want it to).</p>

<p>Rooster is designed to be as configurable as possible so that you can make it work best for you:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You choose which calendars for Rooster to pay attention to, including your delegate calendars.</li>
	<li>Choose if you want location URLs opened automatically.</li>
	<li>Choose if you want Rooster to send macOS user notifications.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's lot's of ways to configure and have fun with the sounds:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Choose from many different sounds (or none) to play when a meeting starts. Currently there are almost 100 sounds to choose from.</li>
	<li>Choose up to three sounds play sequentially instead of just a single boring sound.</li>
	<li>Have Rooster choose a random sound for you each time.*</li>
	<li>Sounds can repeat a few times or can repeat indefinitely in "Car Alarm Mode".</li> 
</ul>

<p>The sounds run the gamut from annoying to pleasant to funny and maybe a little rude, so hopefully there's a perfect sound for you.</p>
